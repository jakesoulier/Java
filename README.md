# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}
For my first introduction to Java language, I choose to create a matching game where a user can make a guess and try to randomly find a match.  The main purpose for this was for me to explore the language and syntax of Java.
{Provide a description the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Java language.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
