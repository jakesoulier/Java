# Overview

For my first introduction to Java language, I choose to create a matching game where a user can make a guess and try to randomly find a match.  The main purpose for this was for me to explore the language and syntax of Java.

# Development Environment

I used Java and imported java.until.*

I also used intellij to create and compile my code.

# Useful Websites

* [W3 Schools Java](https://www.w3schools.com/java/)
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

# Future Work

* Better system of checking if a guess was made or not.
* Building it in a grid of 4x4.
* Putting it in a visual or GUI.
